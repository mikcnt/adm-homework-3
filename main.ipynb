    "# 1. Data Collection\n",
    "Maybe it is important to write some notes about this part. There are two main possible approaches to retrieve correctly the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical one is to just retrieve the books using `requests`. This obviously works, and as long as the syntax is correct, there is no problem with that. Unfortunately, downloading one book at a time takes a really long time, going from 10 to 20 hours. This is a lot, even if we split the work between teammates! A simple but effective trick could be to run the same program different times, simultaneously. In fact, this doesn't represent a heavy task (at least for our pc!). To exploit this little trick, we have to make sure that the program is actually starting from different points, and that there is no overlapping between the different runs. Moreover, we don't want to download books that we already downloaded, even if an overlapping takes place. Actually, this is something that we want to make sure for each and every approach we can think of!\n",
    "\n",
    "If we actually try to exploit this trick, we can see that our computer can run several (more than 10, for instance) runs at once. This fact should certainly encourage us to consider a different approach: if our computer can actually run different instances at the same time without making a sound, maybe there is a better (and more natural) way to approach this problem! And in fact there is! This kind of work is well described by one single word: multiprocessing! Ok, maybe more than one: multiprocessing, multithreading, asynchronous programming... etc. These are all different words that describe similar phenomenons, that we can summarise with: make our pc do different things at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to use asynchronous programming, using the `asyncio` library. It is not actually that easy to understand what this does, at least without first becoming somewhat proficient, but the main concept is that we let our system download multiple chunks of books at the same time. This really makes the download go faster! For instance, we were able to download the complete set of books htmls (30000) in just 20 minutes. Cool, isn't it? We're not going to explain every single passage of the program here, but this is the idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we downloaded the html pages for the best book pages (e.g., https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1.Best_Books_Ever?page=1). From these, we extracted all the links (and we actually did this in a pretty standard way), then we proceedeed with the download of the 30000 html pages, downloading simultaneously batches of 100 books. Once this was done, we used `rm_fails` to remove books that were either corrupted or empty (books with a size too small).\n",
    "\n",
    "If one wants to learn a little bit more about asynchronous programming, there is an interesting link explaining some of the basics (and not so basic). The blogpost name, [I’m too stupid for AsyncIO](https://whatisjasongoldstein.com/writing/im-too-stupid-for-asyncio/), let's us understand that we're all on the same boat. It's an hard programming paradigm."

    "## 1.3 Dataset cleaning [preliminary steps]\n",
    "Before actually jumping into the work itself, we want our dataframe to be clean, meaning that there are some preliminary steps we need to perform on it. First of all, missing data is something we should pay attention to. Lots of rows are going to have missing data somewhere, and dealing with missing data it's not that nice. Notice that this will include different strategies for each of the column we will be considering (more details below). Then there is the problem with punctuation, stopwords, stems and so on so forth, so basic text data preprocessing. Let's make a brief recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Missing data**\n",
    "    - `bookTitle`: if a book is missing the title, then we can safely just remove the instance. In fact, books that are missing the title are actually missing all the informations, meaning that there is a problem with the GoodReads specific link. Also, even if a book was missing just the title, we wouldn't have a way to refer to it, thus it wouldn't be really useful considering we're building a search engine.\n",
    "    - `bookSeries`, `Authors`, `Plot`, `PublishingDate`, `Characters`, `Setting`: if a book is missing one of the above mentioned columns, we can still include the book in the data, since the search engine could for example work with just the title. Obviously, we cannot just leave the values missing, since it would be really hard to perform any operation on that. These are all text columns, therefore the best way to address the missing values prolem is to replace NaNs with empty strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text data preprocessing**\n",
    "    - Punctuation removal: this is the first step we want to perform, since it is going to make the next steps much easier (e.g., language detection will be easier if there aren't plots composed just by punctuation symbols).\n",
    "    - Language detection: before doing anything else, we want to remove the books that present the books for which the plot isn't in english.\n",
    "    - Stopwords removal (of the `Plot` column only)\n",
    "    - Stemming (of the `Plot` column only)\n",
    "    - Lowercase"

This shouldn't be the case! If we apply stemming again, we should solve this issue."

In a more realistic scenario, we're just going to have our database,and we wouldn't have any specific a priori pattern whatsoever.

    "Our second attempt is made by taking into account some simple ranking score: the cosin similarity between the tfidf vector space of the query, and the one produced by the documents retrieved by a simple conjunctive query search. Moreover, now we are just going to show a small slice of the complete results dataframe. This is not reductive in any way! In fact, if we retrieve just a small amount of documents, the user can actually manually go result by result searching for what he was really asking. Not only that, but if we think about big search engines (Google, for instance) and how we use them, it's really uncommon to go after the first page of results. This happens because we humans are intrinsically lazy! And also, cause it's not really that easy to discern good results from bad ones, so we just expect the first ones to be good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, cosin similarity isn't really the best solution, because we're lacking important information. In fact, what we would expect our book description to be, isn't actually what it always is. We have to remember that the `Plot` column of our database contains just small summaries of the books, not the entire book text. It would change the world to have the complete book texts in our hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B.: there are actually many works, completely unrelated to this one, that proves that the interity of the text of singular books can infer really interesting info; simple machine learning models can extract author, literary genre and so on so forth."

    "\n",
    "For this particular task, we didn't feel like a search engine like this could benefit from multiple type of information in the query. Instead, we tought about creating a new scoring function by analizing ratings value, ratings count and book title. In fact, the vast majority of times the user is more inclined in doing particular task in a single query, instead of adding more fields to the query itself. This means that a user probably prefers to write the name of the book or just some words to describe it, and then he just waits for the books that he wants to appear. In order to do that, we need to keep in mind that more often than not a user is interested in the most famous books, so the ones that have a really high number of ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is probably optimal to give some value to the fact that a book is well written, and therefore that it has good ratings. Unfortunately, in our opinion the rating value isn't really telling, since it is often the case that a user either gives a max score to an item, or he gives the worst. Also, we need to keep in mind that we're considering a list of so-called \"best books\", so they probably all have good ratings (or at least the vast majority of them). We can analyze this trend, by looking at the `ratingValue` column. As we can see from the below cell, the vast majority of books have a value between 4 and 5, just one slot. This means that the weight we are going to give to this factor is going to be really low."

For this reason, we used an exact match search in the book title, meaning that for each word in the query, we give value to this kind of match if and only if the word appears in a book title.

    "The first function, `cumpage_serie`, is just an helper function: it is just used to retrieve the cumulative number of pages written in a certain year for each of the 10 series we are considering. However, we also decided to include the below plot (figure 1), showing these values.\n",

    "Anyway, what's really asked is to show the number of pages written from an year to another, and we decided to do it in the way you can see from figure 2. Basically, you can see that we used lines-plot using points as markers. Even though this doesn't really make sense (since we are working with year-data, we don't have, or at least we didn't consider, stronger granularity), it makes much easier to follow the path of a certain book serie. You can also notice that at some point some of the lines stop, and that means that that particular serie didn't continue after a certain amount of time."
