    "## 1.3 Dataset cleaning [preliminary steps]\n",
    "Before actually jumping into the work itself, we want our dataframe to be clean, meaning that there are some preliminary steps we need to perform on it. First of all, missing data is something we should pay attention to. Lot's of rows are going to have missing data somewhere, and dealing with missing data it's not that nice. Notice that this will include different strategies for each of the column we will be considering (more details below). Then there is the problem with punctuation, stopwords, stems and so on so forth, so basic text data preprocessing. Let's make a brief recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Missing data**\n",
    "    - `bookTitle`: if a book is missing the title, then we can safely just remove the instance. In fact, books that are missing the title are actually missing all the informations, meaning that there is a problem with the GoodReads specific link. Also, even if a book was missing just the title, we wouldn't have a way to refer to it, thus it wouldn't be really useful considering we're building a search engine.\n",
    "    - `bookSeries`, `Authors`, `Plot`, `PublishingDate`, `Characters`, `Setting`: if a book is missing one of the above mentioned columns, we can still include the book in the data, since the search engine could for example work with just the title. Obviously, we cannot just leave the values missing, since it would be really hard to perform any operation on that. These are all text columns, therefore the best way to address the missing values prolem is to replace NaNs with empty strings.\n",
    "    - `ratingValue`, `NumberofPages`: TODO?\n",
    "2. **Text data preprocessing**\n",
    "    - Punctuation removal: this is the first step we want to perform, since it is going to make the next steps much easier (e.g., language detection will be easier if there aren't plots composed just by punctuation symbols).\n",
    "    - Language detection: before doing anything else, we want to remove the books that present the books for which the plot isn't in english.\n",
    "    - Stopwords removal (of the `Plot` column only)\n",
    "    - Stemming (of the `Plot` column only)\n",
    "    - Lowercase"

Also, you can see that all the books that are missing the `bookTitle` are also missing all the remaining data.\n",
